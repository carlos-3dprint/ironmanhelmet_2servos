For power up the helmet we have 2 options...

Option 1: 
1 x 9VDC batteries

Option 2:
1 x TP4056 (Lithium Battery Charging Board)
1 x 3.7 VDC lithium rechargeable battery ( 2 000 mAh)

Recommendations
- Test everything on a Breadboard before installing on the helmet
- You will need some wires and jumpers for wiring
- It is important to protect every LiPo battery wit a TP4056 board, as they can get damaged if we don't have this protection
- Go for a curstom PCB board if you have any around
